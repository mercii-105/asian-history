The history of Asia can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe. 
See History of the Middle East and History of the Indian Subcontinent for further details on those regions.
