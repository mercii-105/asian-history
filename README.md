# asian-history
exploring and sharing my interests in asian history.
hello! and welcome to my asian history page.
growing up in asia, as an indian - my continent has always fascinated me
it is hard to find similarities between a state to state or province to province in the same country
with such differences, history always has something more to offer, so let's explore!
my main interests evolve around how dynasties rose and fell, thanks <3
